**Purpose:**  
Visuals convert complex concepts into clear, structured, and digestible information.

### Key Aspects

- **Simplification and Clarity**  
  Visuals simplify complex ideas by providing a blueprint clearer than text alone.  
  They turn abstract system concepts into understandable workflows and structures.

- **Enhanced Communication and Collaboration**  
  Diagrams provide a shared understanding for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
  They align teams on design logic and system interactions.

- **Documentation and Decision-Making**  
  Visuals serve as system references for maintenance and upgrades.  
  They also aid decision-making on scalability and performance by showing data flow and architecture.

## Group 15: Editing, Proofreading & Quality Assurance in Technical Documentation

**Topic:**  
Our presentation explored the essential processes involved in maintaining high-quality technical documentation. We emphasized the three levels of editing—**developmental editing**, **copyediting**, and **proofreading**—and how each contributes to clarity, consistency, and accuracy. Additionally, we discussed the significance of navigational elements like glossaries, indexes, and tables of contents (TOCs), as well as the critical role of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and quality assurance tools.
